# Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=**"True" in config file or environment variables, 
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts.
**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.
