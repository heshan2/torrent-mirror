# Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=**"True" in config file or environment variables, 
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts.
**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

## Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
<details>
    <summary><b>Click Here For More Details</b></summary>

Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need. 
**Warning**: abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google. 

**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice.
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

Or you can create Service Accounts to current project, no need to create new one

- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
If you want to add Service Accounts to Google Group, follow these steps

- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd -
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager.

**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

</details>

## Add all the Service Accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in Youtube-dl or for protected Index Links, edit the netrc file according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. Youtube, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.
